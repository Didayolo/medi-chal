### Provide access to medical data through data generation and challenges

Data science allowed great advancements in many application domains : image recognition, speech synthesis, credit risk analysis and much more. Challenges are motivating, attract people and contribute to this progress.

Many interesting statistical studies could be conducted in the medical field. However medical data are sensitives and raise privacy issues. A solution to this problem could be to use machine learning to generate new data distributions similar to the original datasets, but without confidential information about patients. 

The goal of the project is therefore to create two data challenges on medical problems with newly generated data. This project is part of a bigger project named the Incite Project.
